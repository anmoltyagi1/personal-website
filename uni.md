#### About The App

This hackathon project was built to predict the chances of acceptance in an University of Waterloo engineering/computer science program along with displaying generic information about the university's application statistics from previous years.

Using data of previous years' applicants, a linear regression model was used to scan through the data to come to a conclusion of whether or not the user would recieve an offer of admission.

### Languages and Frameworks Used:

- Python
- Pandas
