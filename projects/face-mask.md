#### About The App

During the COVID-19 pandemic it was important to keep social distancing and safety protocols in measure. Wearing masks was crucial for one's safety. Places such as malls, hospitals, schools, and more had made masks mandatory to wear inside the building. ðŸ˜·ðŸ¦ 

This application detects whether or not the user is wearing a face mask. Using supervised machine learning, the software is able to train itself by looking at sets of data of pictures of faces with masks on, and with masks off. First, a face is detected using Tensorflow and that face is then compared to two different sets of data. Based on the face, it matches with one of the sets and outputs the state of the user's face. ðŸ¦¾
