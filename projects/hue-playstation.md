#### About The App

Whenever I decide to play on my Playstation, the lights in my room always shed glare onto my TV, making it really hard for me to see the game I am playing. I decided that I would make a Python script that would turn the lights in my room off or turn them to a dimmer colour whenever my Playstation would turn on. ðŸŽ®

This automation app allows the user to control Phillips Hues based on their device's setting. The original automation was developed with a PlayStation 5 as the device used to control the lights. ðŸ’¡
