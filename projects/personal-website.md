#### About The App

This site was made to showcase myself along with some of my work with software development. 

This website was built using Next Js and React js. The reason as to why I chose Next Js was because of its ability to dynamically route and server side rendering. Having multiple pages for projects and blogs can be annoying to make and also very unefficient to fetch. With Next Js's dynamic routing this is made much easier. 👨🏽‍💻

### Languages and Frameworks Used:

- NextJS
- ReactJS
